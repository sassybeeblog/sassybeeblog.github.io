title: What does "Sassy Little Bee Blog" represent?
---

Welcome to the Sassy Little Bee Blog. Here, you will find posts about topics in the world of bees. I have many intentions with this blog, but we'll see what actually ends up happening. However, let me lay out some goals and give you a sense for what this space represents to me.

First, my name is [John Mola](http://johnmola.com). I'm a PhD candidate at the University of California Davis. I have been studying bees and their ecology for close to a decade now. As such, I receive a lot of questions about bees...and I receive a lot of the same questions over and over again and there's not really one place to send people (especially folks who are not already researchers of some sort). This is both inspiring and annoying -- I'm glad people are readily excited to learn about bees, but dang is it a snooze to answer the same questions again...and again. It is my hope that with the Sassy Little Bee Blog that I can educate folks on some basics of bees and I can do it in my own way -- with sarcasm, with dry humor, and with sass of course. I also care that the information makes sense and is easily digestible. Additionally, this is a nice change of pace for me as most of the writing I do is for grant proposals and scientific papers which have the excitement of a bag of flour. 

Another goal, and perhaps it should have been the first goal, is to teach people about how freaking cool bees are. *According to a survey I just made up*, millions of people each year choose elephants, tigers, wolves, dogs, penguins, and other large animals for their spririt animal. *Terrible choices*. Instead, people should be choosing **bees**: sassy, hard-working, unapologetic, fuzzy, and categorically cute creatures who help plants fuck. It is my mission to convince readers that bees are the best, and it doesn't necessarily take a journey down their deep evolutionary history to believe so. I make no apologies about some of the information being rather surface-level (except maybe this one), and instead I will direct you towards other resources where you can learn the excruciating details. In other words: I will teach about dope shit as I see it. We'll cover the basics, of course, because I want you to be able to say you know a thing or two about bees, but from there we'll spiral out of control to discuss whatever comes to mind and seems fascinating. 

If that sounds cool, read on. If not...byyyyyeeeee.
