title: What does "Sassy Little Bee Blog" represent?

**Short version:** Self-important PhD student studies bees; wants to tell you about them. 

**Long version:**

Welcome to the Sassy Little Bee Blog. Here, you will find posts about topics in the world of bees. I have many intentions with this blog, but we'll see what actually ends up happening.

First, my name is [John Mola](http://johnmola.com). I'm a PhD candidate at the University of California Davis. I was not born to be an academic or to appreciate Earth's natural splendor. Instead, I was raised to be sarcastic, play sports, and to think Mountain Dew is a socially-acceptable drink. These characteristics are often at odds with the Ivory Tower and the smugness of academia. I wasn't necessarily even expected to go to college, but 10 years of post-high school education later, I have flung myself wholeheartedly into the belly of the beast. I even have strong opinions on ergonomic mouse designs. I have become what I was raised to mock. 

I have been studying bees and their ecology for close to a decade now. As such, I receive a lot of questions about bees. I love this. People are fascinated, interested, and curious to know more about bees. We hear on the news there's a problem with pollinators, we see in movies that killer bees are coming to get us, or we heard that a ton of the food we eat relies on bees. However, when I allow my humility to fail, when I feel like I was born knowing about bees, when I forget my roots, I become moody. I receive the same questions over and over again. I am distressed. Smug. Pretentious. Sassy.  

It is my hope that with the Sassy Little Bee Blog that I can educate folks on some basics of bees and I can do it in my own lighthearted way. The information here should just make sense and be easily digestible. For the reader, I believe this fits into a nice space between the other work that's out there on bees/pollinators. For me, this is a nice change of pace as most of the writing I do is for grant proposals and scientific papers which have the literary flare of a bag of flour. 

Another goal, and perhaps it should have been the first goal, is to teach people about how freaking cool bees are. *According to a survey I just made up*, millions of people each year choose elephants, tigers, wolves, dogs, penguins, and other large animals for their spririt animal. There are *terrible choices*. Instead, choose **bees**: hard-working, unapologetic, fuzzy, and categorically cute creatures who help plants fuck. It is my mission to convince readers that bees are the best, and it doesn't necessarily take a journey down their deep evolutionary history to know it. I make no apologies about some of the information being rather surface-level (except maybe this one), and instead I will direct you towards other resources where you can learn the excruciating details. We'll cover the basics, of course, because I want you to be able to say you know a thing or two about bees, but from there we'll spiral out of control to discuss whatever comes to mind and seems fascinating. 

If that sounds cool, read on. If not...byyyyyeeeee. 

**Even more:**

Oh, one last thing if you're still here - this is a project for me. A trial. In person, it's easy for me to use tone and body language to show I'm actually happy to be there behind my sassy persona. However, it's not necessarily easy to translate a sarcastic, dry, and cynical sense of humor into a text-based format.  As such, I welcome all feedback on what works and what doesn't. Let me know if my attempts at self-aware smugness actually come off as just plain ol' smug.
