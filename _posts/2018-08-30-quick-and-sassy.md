When you work with or study bees for a living, it's great because people are often instantly interested. It's also terrible because *people are often instantly interested*. 

Imagine it. You're at the dentist, or a potluck, or just trying to make socially-obligated small talk, and **bam**. It happens.

> "What do you do?" 

You try to keep it *boring* but eventually the "bee" word comes out. 

Their eyes fill with *genuine interest and joy*. 

Your heart sinks. Here it comes, 

> "Oh wow. Do you get stung a lot?" 

Ugggh. *This question again?...* You groan with self-importance. 

And what's worse - what if you're the normal person who now has to deal with this bee-prick? 

Fear no more! 

Below I have answered the most common questions about bees. Bee nerds and normal people rejoice - now nobody has to talk to each other!

(Note: Each answer is short and then you have the option to read much more about it either from myself or another source.)

# Coming Soon...

### 1. Why are the bees dying?

This is probably the most common question we receive as bee researchers. Other variants include, "So what's up with the bees?" "Oh yeah I heard there's a problem with the bees, right?" etc. 

And it's a hard one to answer, because there's a decent amount of background knowledge someone has to have to really get it. So it's a long answer, it's boring if you're not really interested, and it's complicated. 

Sound like too much to read? Fine. Then the answer is bees are dying because of...

- Habitat loss
- Climate change
- Pesticides
- Disease
- Poor nutrition
- And a cocktail of all of the above. 

You may be looking at that list and thinking, "those factors could hurt almost any species!" You're right. A lot of the problems bees face are problems that wildlife faces all over the world. Bees, birds, mammals, frogs, and lizards alike. That's awful, but also provides hope for a unified front to fight these problems. 

So there's your short, overly simplistic answer. 

If you're feeling motivated, [here's](../../whybeesdying) a longer answer (c'mon, do it). 

And if you're feeling really really motivated, I suggest you read Dave Goulson's bumble bee books. 

### 2. What's that colony collapse disorder thing?
### 3. Do you get stung a lot?

Nope! But maybe folks who study honey bees do. 

Most bees are docile and will not sting unless trapped (such as between your foot and the ground, or if you actually hold them in your fist).

Also, only honey bee workers die when they sting. This happens because they have barbed stingers (think fish-hook shaped) that get yanked out when they sting. The other 19,999+ bee species do not have barbed stingers, and so can keep on living when they're done. 

More. Here. 
 
### 4. Do you know where I can get good honey?

No.

### 5. Oh yeah bees are important, we got a real problem with the bees...

This isn't a question, but I guess it's cool that your brother's ex-boyfriend's step-mother keeps bees. No bee-splaining, please, sir. 

### 6. Should I keep honey bees?

Yikes!

My sassy answer: No. Honey bees are imperialist colonizers. 

My careful answer: Thank you for your enthusiasm for saving the bees! I don't want to discourage you from using your energy to help save these important pollinators -- however, keeping honey bees will not help conserve bees. 

hoeny bees are managed pollinators...

### 7. How do I kill carpenter bees and those picnic bees?

It is a strange human habit that we seek to kill wildlife at the most minor of inconvenience. You'd be surprised at how often we (people who literally want to save bees!) get asked how to best kill bees. Or maybe you're a cynic and you know exactly how often we get asked this. 

Carpenter bees...(mitigate, manage...)

Picnic bees...(actually wasps)

### 8. My [friend, neighbor, in-law] has a [unknown amount of bees (probably actually wasps)] in their yard, do you want them?

No thanks. 

### 9. Without bees we won't have food, right? 

Well...

### 10. Is honey good for allergies?

No. But I wish it was true. 

I am a pollination ecologist who gets at least one bloody nose each spring from terrible pollen allergies. It's basically a right of passage each research season -- I know I have put my time in when my nose bleeds. 

But here's the thing, the plants that bees visit are by definition animal pollinated plants. These plants send up beautiful displays of flowers to attract bees to land on them, collect the pollen and feed on the nectar, and then hopefully move to another flower of the same species and deliver a little bit of pollen for them (Dr. Pat Willmer describes this as "trading food for sex" in her massive text book). These plants go through all of this effort because their pollen is precious. They want to carefully move it from one flower to another. This is the type of pollen that will end up in honey. But this is not the type of pollen that causes our miserable sneeze-fests. 

Wind-pollination is the culprit. It is the pollens of ragweed, trees, and grasses that penetrate our nostrils and line the pockets of the antihistimine pharmecutical executives. These lazy participants of evolution have adopted the strategy of just throwing billions of pollen grains into the air and hoping that it lands on another flower. Of course, most of it is wasted and seemingly only exists to ruin your day. 

So no - if the logic behind consuming local honey to stop allergies is that it contains bits of the pollen driving you mad, but the bees don't ever visit those plants, then why would it help? Oh plus honey doesn't really have that much pollen in it anyway.
