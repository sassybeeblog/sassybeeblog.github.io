When you work with or study bees for a living, it's great because people are often instantly interested. It's also terrible because *people are often instantly interested*. 

Imagine it. You're at the dentist, or a potluck, or just trying to make socially-obligated small talk, and **bam**. It happens.

> "What do you do?" 

You try to keep it *boring* but eventually the "bee" word comes out. 

Their eyes fill with *genuine interest and joy*. 

Your heart sinks. Here it comes, 

> "Oh wow. Do you get stung a lot?" 

Ugggh. *This question again?...* You groan with self-importance. 

And what's worse - what if you're the normal person who now has to deal with this bee-prick? 

Fear no more!
