When you work with or study bees for a living, it's great because people are often instantly interested. It's also terrible because often people are instantly interested. Now you're tasked with explaining the thing that you're supposedly relentlessly passionate about...but all you really want to do is hang out at this potluck long enough until it's socially acceptable to duck out. Or you're just sick of answering the same questions. It's not fair to the well-intentioned person asking the questions, but these questions make bee people grumpy. So here, I offer a one-stop shop to some of the most common bee questions. 

### 1. Why are the bees dying?
### 2. What's that colony collapse disorder?
### 3. Do you get stung a lot?
### 4. Do you know where I can get good honey?
### 5. Oh yeah bees are important, we got a real problem with the bees...
### 6. Should I keep bees?
### 7. How do I kill carpenter bees and those picnic bees?
### 8. My [friend, neighbor, in-law] has a [unknown amount of bees (probably actually wasps)] in their yard, do you want them?
### 9. Without bees we won't have food, right? 
### 10. Is honey good for allergies?
