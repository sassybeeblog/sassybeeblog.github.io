title: Why are bees dying?
---

The first thing folks have to know before we can even address the question is who "the bees" are. There are over 20,000 species of bee across the globe with all sorts of different habitat requirements, flowers they prefer, and environmental conditions they can handle. And of course, there's certainly no wise all-knowing bee we can go ask "what's the deal?" Instead, we rely on data which varies in quality and coverage due to the difficulty of capturing, cataloging, and identifying most species - and also a our disproportionate (but understandable) interest in the species that are important for agriculture. (Aside: This is a source of envy for bee biologists. While folks studying large mammals or birds can use all sorts of gadgets to get massive data sets, you certainly can't stick a 5 pound radio collar on a bee.) 

So for the vast majority of bee species, the answer to "how are the bees doing?"

> "Y'all, we have no idea. Please give us money to collect more data."

OK, enough nuance. What people *probably mean* when they ask this question is "**Hey I heard some stuff on the news about bees dying. Explain, nerd.**" In this case, folks are probably concerned with the decline of the European Honeybee (1 species) and maybe reports of declining bumble bee populations (over 250 species). For our purposes, we'll divide bees into "managed" and "wild" bees. By managed bees, I mean the ones we can put in a box and move around to pollinate crops. By wild bees, I mean ones that live and work where they please. And because nuance is unavoidable, keep in mind that some of the threats affect both managed and wild populations - and sometimes the threats to wild populations may be the managed populations themselves! Whew. 

So here's what's threatening honey bees and other managed bees.

And here's what's threatening wild bees. 

Maybe you're reading those lists and thinking, "hey, that sounds like what I heard about threats to [some other animal]." You would be right! Just like birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and other more "well known" animals, the things that threaten bees are threats to wildlife as we know it. Loss of habitat, emerging diseases, agrochemicals, and climate change are bad for the birds and the bees.
